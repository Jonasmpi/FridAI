# Frid.AI
## What is this?
Minimal examples for basic artificial neural network architectures, problems, layers and general techniques.
These examples are targeted at coders without experience in using artificial neural networks.
I will try and expand the number of examples to cover a wide spectrum of different areas and use cases. 

## How to install?
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you dont have it already
3. Be sure `pip` as well as `python` are in your `PATH`
